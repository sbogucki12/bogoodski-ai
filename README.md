# BOGOODSKI-AI Portfolio Website

![canva](media/readme/canva.jpg)

This project is a portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed to be fully responsive across various device screen sizes. The website has been deployed on GitHub pages and can be accessed at [https://sbogucki12.github.io/](https://sbogucki12.github.io/). The entire chat dialog that "developed" this site is here: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/9a9edc00-4256-4717-8ed7-a0c69faf8828)

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to utilize generative artificial intelligence, primarily ChatGPT, to generate a portfolio website. This approach leverages AI capabilities to streamline and enhance the web development process.

## Progress

- **Day 2: Aug. 2, 2023:**

On day 2, we added a resume feature and a favicon to the website. The resume feature consists of a modal that contains a carousel with different sections of the resume. This content was structured and styled by ChatGPT based on text provided from a LinkedIn profile. The favicon addition helps to identify the website in browser tabs.
