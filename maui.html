                <p>Being tourists, we had no supplies stored.  Incredibly, we actually traveled toward Lahaina, during the fire, in search of food; not because we were being insensitive in the face of catastrophe but because the ambiguity of the situation on the ground left us totally ignorant to the significance of the event occurring before us.</p>

                <h2>Sunday, August 6, 2023. </h2>
        
                <h2>A friend and I traveled to Maui on Sunday, August 6, 2023.  My friend had previously lived on the island. She even had family who had only recently relocated from the Lahaina area. Her connection to the area was strong, and she was excited to show me the town and island on which she has so many cherished memories.  </h2>
        
                <p>This was my first trip to Hawaii. </p>
        
                <p>Immediately, Maui‚Äôs tropical beauty exceeded my lofty expectations. </p>
        
                <video src="media/images/maui/maui-rental-video.mp4" class="maui-video" controls></video>
        
                <p>Growing naturally along the walkway to our rental unit were the same exotic flowers that I had only seen previously in pots and gardens.  Our backyard was the Pacific Ocean, orientated in the direction of the setting sun.  Follow a short trail one way and discover a small secluded beach. Follow it the other way, and encounter the nesting spot for sun-bathing sea turtles, many times older than the U.S. state in which they were resting.    </p>

                <p>Immediately, I felt like I had discovered the place I was meant to be.  Moved not only by the visual allure of it all, but also by an island that provoked my appreciation for the outdoors.  For so long in other places, I‚Äôve felt a bit ostracized because I don‚Äôt drink nor participate in typical social activities.  In Maui, I quickly discovered that my activities were the preferred social activities!  I couldn‚Äôt resist the yearning notion that this could one day be home.</p>
                
                <p>I was quickly introduced to the local cuisine, to my palete‚Äôs absolute approval.  After exploring Whalers Village in Kaanapali, we returned to our rental property and ordered delivery.  The delivery was apparently straight from heaven and referred to locally as Lau Lau (link: https://onolicioushawaii.com/lau-lau). ü§§</p>
                
                <img src="media/images/maui/maui-lau_lau.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
                <p>Maybe one of the tastiest things I‚Äôve ever eaten. </p>
                
                <p>But the theme that I most want to make apparent to you, and the one that most resoundingly resides with me today, is the gracious spirit of the Maui people.  Beyond the food and even beyond the unique and stunning natural scenery of the state, Hawaii - to me - is defined by its spirit of Aloha.  </p>

            <h2>Monday, Aug. 7, 2023. </h2>
        
            <p>Maui‚Äôs Aloha spirit perhaps hit us first Monday morning when we visited Hawaiian Village Coffee. (link: https://www.yelp.com/biz/hawaiian-village-coffee-lahaina).  There, we were chatted up as if we were locals. By the locals!  We picked up a store punch card, joking about how quickly we were going to fill the card up on purchases of macadamia nut lattes. </p>
        
            <p>We immediately seized the day, visiting Kaanapali Beach, where I got to snorkel for the very first time.  Below us, we saw schools of fish, urchin, eels, a reef shark (!) and even scuba divers.  I lazily floated on a boogie board and would have happily spent the rest of my life on the surface of that turquoise-shaded liquid glass.  </p>
        
            <p>Though we failed to capture any pictures this time, we picked up an underwater camera for next time.  Because, no doubt, much snorkeling was still to be had this week! </p>
        
            <p>On this day, however, our final adventure was a sunset sail from Lahaina Harbor.  </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/maui-sail-0.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        
            <p>We were embraced again by the Aloha spirit as we stepped aboard Sail Maui‚Äôs Paragon catamaran. The captain and crew were kind and jovial.  </p>
        
            <p>I can‚Äôt pinpoint the exact words that made us feel so welcomed.  It‚Äôs more of a sense that we could feel.  But it was very real.  In fact, we were so moved that we scrounged as big of a tip as we could find in our pockets. If we had more to give we would have.  We just really appreciated the experience, born of the remarkable (but common in Maui) hospitality.  </p>
        
            <p>We floated peacefully toward the setting sun; behind us, the sleepy nook of the quaint Lahaina Harbor.  </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/lahaina_harbor.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        
            <p>Meanwhile, another visitor was traveling toward Hawaii, though many hundred of miles south. </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/Hurricane_dora-path.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
            <p>Hurricane Dora</p>
        
            <h2>No one and I mean, no one, was talking about Hurricane Dora on Monday night.  Though the wind had increased throughout the day and had become quite blustery, Mother Nature was hardly presenting a warning for what she had in store. </h2>
        
            <h2>Back in the rental unit, the volume on our t.v. went on the fritz.  The source of the problem was a poorly performing HDMI cable.  As we went to bed Monday night, that was our only worldly concern. We would fix that tomorrow, we thought.  </h2>

        <section class="reveal-section hidden">
            <h2>Tuesday, Aug. 8, 2023. </h2>
        
            <p>Now, to understand how our Tuesday worked, and to better understand why conditions eventually grew so calamitous, it‚Äôs first important to understand that there are very few passable highways in Maui.  From our rental property, we basically had one road (highway 30, the Honoapi ªilani Highway) and two options - go left toward Kapalua and eventually north and around the perimeter of a volcano, or go right and head toward Lahaina.  And that‚Äôs it. </p>
        
            <p>Waking up to no electricity on Tuesday, we decided to head left - toward Napili in search of coffee.  We quickly discovered that power was not on there, nor in Kapalua.  So, we kept driving. Highway 30 eventually becomes Hawaii Route 340, the Kahekili Highway; also occasionally referred to as Maui‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeath Road‚Äù (link: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29220-d1074974-r297404808-Kahekili_Highway-Maui_Hawaii.html)</p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/tuesday_drive-road.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        
            <p>For the next two hours or so, we saw maybe a total of three other cars on the road. We had no clue the explanation for the desolation.  It was early in the day and we figured this might be the reason why.   But that, along with winds that nearly blew us off the cliffs, was starting to raise our suspicions.  </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/mahina_surf-to-kahului.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        
            <p>Despite the conditions, the drive was an extraordinarily scenic one. The road was narrow but easily passable.  It scissored through the lush green forests and along towering abutments that protruded into the ocean and dropped steeply to where the waves crashed onto rocky black and tan sand beaches.  The sheer grandeur took away whatever remaining breath the wind hadn‚Äôt already stolen.  </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/tuesday_drive-steve.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
            <img src="media/images/maui/tuesday_drive-0.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">

            <img src="media/images/maui/tuesday_drive-4.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        
            <p>Now, here‚Äôs the crazy part and a fact - that in retrospect - really stings.  We actually made it to Kahului. Where the electricity and regular daily activity was flowing.  So little was our awareness of the events around us that we actually departed the safety and comfort of Kahului and headed back to Lahaina!  </p>
        
            <p>One of the soon-to-be many seemingly innocuous decisions that would actually have critical implications.  </p>
        
            <p>I think this bears repeating: On Tuesday, the day of the Lahaina fire, we left a totally secured place and returned to the very place of danger.  We would have never thought of doing such a thing had we any idea what was really going on.  </p>
        
            <p>No one knew.  </p>
        
            <p>Let‚Äôs pause here.  The events that are about to transpire were, per my observation, the result of the alignment of several unique causal hazards that alone could have been mitigated but, together, resulted in devastation. </p>
        
            <p>The surreal but important fact to keep in mind is that folks in West Maui had no idea what was going on in Lahaina on Tuesday.  Or Wednesday, for that matter. We had no power and spotty cell service.  </p>
        
            <p>Knowing what I know now, the actions that we took on Tuesday are chilling in reflection.  </p>
        
            <p>We arrived in Lahaina from Kahului around noon, to a big mess.  The wind had ripped down power lines throughout the town and police were blocking intersections to detour traffic around these obstacles.   I recall that the intersection onto Highway 30 was closed because I remember seeing the same Starbucks multiple times, following other lost tourists in aimless circles around shopping center parking lots.  </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/roadblock-lahaina.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        
            <p>We noticed a rough, partially paved side street that ran into the direction of our rental unit that might provide escape.  The road - a stretch to call it that - ran along the north edge of the residential area between Lahaina and the vast, windswept grass fields </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/detour-route.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
            <img src="media/images/maui/escape-satellite.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
            
            <p>The intersections in town were chaotic. People were already lined up stationary on the highway trying to depart Lahaina.  At the time, it seemed that the only risk to attempting that side street was potentially a waste of time.  </p>
            
            <p>We actually drove many miles down that side path.  The road was rough and the dry wind whipping off the fields was growing hazy and hot.  About the only company we saw on that road were two vehicles that nearly collided.  One was turning around while the other rushed by, seemingly in a panic; reasonable to me now, but seemingly questionable at the time.  </p>
            
            <p>After bumping along the trail for about 15 minutes, we reached a closed gate blocking an impassable route.  Disappointed, we turned around, resigned to join the others in the traffic queues in Lahaina.  </p>
            
            <p>On the way back, though, we discovered a little opening that led back to the residential area.  Separating it from the path that we were on was an abrupt, steep bump.  Maybe big enough to see-saw our rental car if we tried to go over it.  We must have been feeling more desperate than I knew because we didn‚Äôt give it much thought before giving it a go.  </p>
            
            <p>And, fortunately, we did.  Our little Kia rental made it over and into a residential area that, in a few short hours, would completely succumb to the blaze that was then about to head toward us.  </p>
            
            <p>I‚Äôm not sharing the details of our seemingly absurd decision-making to self-report my own naivety.  Rather, I think some of you see the fatal consequences of the Maui fire and say, ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt happen to me.‚Äù  In fact, how could that happen to anyone?  Well, now you know.  It happens like this. </p>
            
            <img src="media/images/maui/fire-damage-chart.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
            
            <p>I‚Äôm haunted by the notion now that a seemingly trivial decision had such critical stakes then unbeknownst to me.   Everyone says they know exactly how they‚Äôd react in a critical situation.  But what if you don‚Äôt realize the situation has become critical? We were operating under false assumptions.  </p>
            
            <p>Grateful for the escape we made from Lahaina, we returned to our rental unit. It eventually occurred to us that we had not eaten since the sunset sail on Monday.  The local grocery store was open but there was a long line and we didn‚Äôt make it in time to be allowed to join the queue.  The property on which we were renting had no resources, so we decided to head toward the resorts in Kaanapali, hoping we might be able to salvage something from a hotel.  </p>
        
            <p>Indicative of the extent of our ignorance on Tuesday, we actually headed back toward the fire.  Though we saw the smoke, we thought it was like the wild fires we had seen back in California; always threatening but usually contained before causing real traumatic damage.  </p>
        
            <p>Only in retrospect now do we recognize that we were actually traveling toward the fire that was devouring historic Lahaina town.  </p>
        
            <img src="media/images/maui/lahaina-smoke.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        
            <p>We tried a resort in Kaanapali where we were able to purchase a couple of bags of macadamia nuts.  While my friend ran inside, I was struck for the first time - and the only time during the entire day - by a sense of peril.  The conditions were now certainly of a rainless hurricane.  Gusting winds blistered the air with debris and smoke.  </p>
        
        
            <p>As Tuesday came to an end, we finished our day‚Äôs only meal - a pancake and a handful of nuts.  But our issues were mere inconveniences and not the tragedies being then encountered by others.  </p>
        
            <p>The lack of communication in West Maui created a disturbing dichotomy.  While Lahaina burned, many of us went about our business.  I watched the sunset.  Kids played in the pool.  We simply had no idea the substantial nature of what was occurring mere miles down the road.  </p>

            <h2>Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2023. </h2>
        
        <h2>We continued to be mostly unaware of the severity of the event that was occurring in our vicinity.  I spent a lot of Wednesday in my rental car, charging my phone.  The entire time, I scanned the radio.  Though regular updates came from 92.9 (which called itself 93.5), it was the same recorded status played over and over.  I can practically recite it verbatim: 6 fatalities. All remaining wounded were treated.  Roads were closed but a shuttle was running from Kaanapali to the airport in Kahului.  Throughout the day and into the night, this same report.  Apparently, things weren't great, but they also didn‚Äôt sound much different from wildfire reports familiar from back home.  </h2>
        
        <p>Sitting in the car, we saw another tourist return to our rental complex with grocery bags.  He informed us that a convenience store up the street was open.   We headed there, and joined the queue.  </p>
        
        <img src="media/images/maui/shopping-line-picture-1.jpg" alt="" class="maui-image">
        <video src="media/images/maui/shopping-line-video.mp4" class="maui-video" controls></video>
        
        <p>Where frustration could be rightfully expected, the Aloha spirit wouldn‚Äôt be denied.  Though waiting for hours to enter, everyone was civil.  A local Maui resident in front of us in line allowed us to join her party. So, we got to enter the store a minute or two early due to her graciousness; maybe a small token but it had an outwardly huge and lasting impact.  </p>
        
        <h2>It was only on Wednesday night that I really began to get a sense of what may have occurred in Lahaina, though I chose not to believe it.  And sincerely, I didn‚Äôt - if I‚Äôm being honest.  </h2>
        
        <h2>The intermittent texts that I was receiving started to provide some clarity. But the thing that I now realize about those texts is that the senders understood what was going on in Lahaina, but they totally misunderstood the conditions elsewhere in West Maui. While I never felt in immediate danger, I constantly felt trapped.  Yet, some of the texts made it seem like we could leave - if we just tried harder.  I promise you that was not the case. At least not Tuesday night.  Wednesday was more permissible, but with no consistent communication, no one was certain roads were even open.  </h2>
        
        <p>map-orientation.jpg </p>
        
        <h2>Meanwhile, my Mom had managed to acquire us a new flight for Thursday night. Her assistance throughout this ordeal was steady and necessary. And for it, I‚Äôll always be grateful. </h2>
        
        <h2>Thursday, Aug. 10, 2023</h2>
        
        <h2>Though the fire occurred in Lahaina on Tuesday, I swear to you that it wasn‚Äôt until the drive to the airport on Thursday that I actually believed it.  </h2>
        <p> </p>
        <video src="media/images/maui/evacuation-video.mp4" class="maui-video" controls></video>
        
        <p>At the time of writing, the destruction of the fire has been widely reported.  So, I‚Äôll only add this: I‚Äôm an Army combat veteran and this has me shook.  </p>
        
        <p>From the safety of California from where I currently write, I am learning more and more about what happened in Lahaina.  As I do, my own despair increases. But so also does the connection that I feel to the island and its people.  </p>
        
        <p>My grief is matched by my enormous fondness for the people of Maui.  Nowhere did this fondness grow more than in the Kahului Airport, where I was embraced by the hug of the Aloha spirit. </p>
        
        <h2>Because our flight was delayed overnight until Friday, we couldn‚Äôt check our bags. Because we couldn‚Äôt check our bags, we couldn‚Äôt pass through security. Since we had already returned our rental car and hotels offered no availability, we planned to camp outside ticketing at the airport for the night.   </h2>
        
        <p>My bleak expectation for the night was immediately brightened by a stream of volunteers.  Local Maui folks brought in blankets, (the best) pineapple (ever), water, toiletries, and so much food that we had to eventually turn away offerings. With only many many sincere thank yous from us in return.   </p>
        
        <p>Though a visitor, while at that airport, I felt as if I was a member of the  ªOhana.  </p>
        
        <p>I wrote all of this because I can not thank the people of Maui for their generosity enough.  To return my appreciation, I share the details as I know them to help encourage understanding for those who weren‚Äôt there, and perhaps help answer some questions for those that were.  </p>
        
        
        <p>Though, truthfully, I feel otherwise helpless.  I really wish I could return to the island and assist in a more tangible way.  I intend to return as soon as I can to at least contribute to the local economy as a tourist, once it is respectful and feasible to do so.  I‚Äôd like to return regularly and watch the island heal and, hopefully, observe as Lahaina grows back the right way.  If there is absolutely any way I can help more tangibly, I offer my support.  </p>
        
        <p>In the meanwhile, I donate, and encourage you to consider doing the same.  Please don‚Äôt think there is a deadline for providing support.  My experience was merely an inconvenience.  What the folks down there are dealing with now, and moving forward, is a catastrophe.  Those who lost the most weren‚Äôt the tourists, but the local residents down there who work to make our vacations so memorable.  Others were robbed of places of retirement that they had invested their entire lives in.  People lost their loved ones to fire.  It‚Äôs the most awful thing.  These people need our support.  </p>
        
        <p>We need to demonstrate to Hawaii that the sense of community that they know so well thrives beyond their shores.  </p>
        
        <p>I choose to donate to a GoFundMe account (link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/lahaina-strong-rebuilding-hope-after-fire) for a verified local who I trust to distribute equitably.  But there are many options.  Please consider choosing any (or many!) of them, and helping out.  </p>
        
        <p>I also encourage you to please seek to learn more about the events that occurred in Lahaina.  The survivors are heroes and they need to be recognized.  Though the horror of their stories challenge our willingness to listen, I think we must.  The stories especially of families‚Äô profound demonstrations of love by protecting each other in monumental feats of survival deserve to be forefront in the retelling of the history of these events.  </p>
        
        <p>Finally, I can not complete my own story of Maui, 2023 without acknowledging Alyssa, my friend and constant companion throughout all of this.  I‚Äôll forever respect your refusal to give in to frustration when everything around us seemed to demand it.  That we could maintain levity as appropriate surely made the events more tolerable. That there are so few legitimate events in one‚Äôs life that really change and define it, I‚Äôll always cherish the shared bond of having experienced this one with you.  </p>
